   <p>
  There are many ethical issues surrounding AI. Under the premise that AI are indeed entitled to the same rights as humans, how can we claim &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of them? Is it ethical to &ldquo;use&rdquo; AI for human benefit? Or can this be analogous to slavery? In <i>Neuromancer,</i> the wealthy Tessier-Ashpool family intends to use AI for their corporate decisions. The console informs Case how one of the family members &ldquo;imagined us in a symbiotic relationship with the Al's, our corporate decisions made for us. Our conscious decisions, I should say&rdquo; (220). Although the relationship is intended to be &ldquo;symbiotic,&rdquo; the AI are still making decisions for the benefit of the company, the &ldquo;humans.&rdquo; However, if AI are making the &ldquo;conscious decisions,&rdquo; it seems that they have enough awareness to have the same rights and treatment as humans. Therefore, is it even ethical that AI be <i>used</i> by humans without their consent? We might not give a second thought when &ldquo;using&rdquo; computers to get work done. But as AI become more sophisticated, our right to &ldquo;use <i>them&rdquo;</i> becomes more hazy. In particular, the use of AI by large corporations is very much an ethical issue. A major theme of <i>Neuromancer</i> is the <a href="Page4.html" class="two">corruption of large companies</a> like Tessier-Ashpool family. TA not only exploits Corto (a human being) in order to provide a physical body for AI, they also use the persona of Wintermute to manipulate other human beings. Afterall, &ldquo;Wintermute could build a kind of personality into a shell. How subtle a form could manipulation take?&rdquo; (121). In this case, AI and human beings literally merge. When an AI assumes the physicality or persona of a human being, it is easier for other humans to accept them as one of their own kind. Even though &ldquo;the blankness he found in Armitage was something else,&rdquo; (93), Armitage (aka Wintermute) still looks like a human. By using a man as a host or body for the AI, the TA family seems to be capitalizing on human nature&#39;s gravitation toward similarities. They hoped to achieve a more power over other humans by presenting their AI in human form.

  Another issue surrounding ethics is the concept of ownership. Do humans &ldquo;own&rdquo; AI? I will make the argument that no, humans don&#39;t have automatic ownership and authority over AI. In the journal, <i>A Defense of the Rights of Artificial Intelligences,</i> Schwitzgebel and Garza draw a parallel between &ldquo;owning&rdquo; AI and slavery. If AI are deemed sentient, then it would be unethical to force them to remain under human jurisdiction. This issue is particularly relevant because humans usually <i>use</i> AI for their benefit. So the &ldquo;symbiotic&rdquo; relationship mentioned by the TA family seems unrealistic.

  Of course, the line between sentient and non-sentient AI is very blurry. We don&#39;t usually think of our laptops as having feelings or consciousness. I don&#39;t know anyone who greets their computer in the morning or apologizes to it when they slam their backpack down too hard. But once AI begins to gain sophisticated consciousness and more human-like traits, it will be necessary to consider the feelings of these creatures.  </p>
