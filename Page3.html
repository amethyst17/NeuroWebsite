   <p>
  Armitage&frasl;Corto&frasl;Wintermute. Wintermute&frasl;Armitage&frasl;Corto. Three names, one person. Or can 'it' even be called a person? In <i>Neuromancer,</i> Corto is a fighter in the army. "Human." After being betrayed by his superiors in the war, Corto develops schizophrenia&mdash;a biological screw up&mdash;ah, so typically human. Taking advantage of Corto&#39;s unstable mental state, the Tessier-Ashpool family uses Corto as a physical body for their AI, Wintermute. This new identity, neither human nor computer, becomes Armitage. 
<br><br>
"My name is Armitage" (27).  <i>How nice to meet you, Armitage.</i>
<br><br>
On first glace, Armitage&#39;s &ldquo;broad chest, hairless and muscular,&rdquo; (27) resembles a male&#39;s physique. A human male. Nothing alarming. 
<br><br>
Humans gravitate toward those who look like them or are them. Does giving AI a shell, a facade that either is human or resembles a human, make it more &ldquo;human?&rdquo; I would argue that it does. According to a <a href="http://conf.som.yale.edu/obsummer07/PaperBen-NerKramer.pdf" class="one">Yale study,</a> 200 participants tend to &ldquo;favor those who are similar to them on any of a wide range of categories of identity over those who are not like them.&rdquo; This result is not surprising: evolutionarily, it seems that humans would be attracted to those who are like them, those who are familiar. There is less risk involved, a higher chance of survival. These instincts have manifested in our hesitance to accept AI. They embody the unknown, the potential to become someone, something else. 
<br><br>
By making Armitage a human figure, the TA family plays on the human proclivity to their own kind. <i>Us versus them. Us versus them.</i>
<br><br>
However,  <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html" class="one">Alan Turing</a> presents a somewhat contradictory interpretation of what AI is and can be. He asserts that &ldquo;no engineer or chemist claims to be able to produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel there was little point in trying to make a &#39;thinking machine&#39; more human by dressing it up in such artificial flesh.&rdquo; For Turing, making AI physically resemble humans is not necessary. The human-machine connection is simply not relevant. But I think that the physicality and image of AI plays a major role in how they are perceived. However, because Armitage bears a &ldquo;tanned mask,&rdquo; (93) he only boasts a facade. So is Gibson agreeing with Turing? Does it matter whether or not an AI is a splitting image or a human, or will they always be an impersonal program? 
<br><br>
Sadly, Armitage is never truly content, as his dual identities can&#39;t maintain their &ldquo;delicate balance&rdquo; forever (118). He&#39;s inevitably &ldquo;going to come apart&rdquo; on Case, thus reverting back to his tortured humanity as Corto (118). Gibson seems to be making the argument that Wintermute&frasl;Corto&#39;s identities are mutually exclusive. However, in looking at AI in our society today, I think that the mental and emotional capacities of AI and human will amalgamate to the extent where there is <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/AIRights-150901.pdf" class="one">no relevant difference</a> between the two.
