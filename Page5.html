  Cogito ergo sum. Je pense, donc je suis.

With the dawn of new technology, AI in particular, it is easy to overlook the important roles that philosophy, ethics, and humanities play in this science-heavy field. The thoughts and intent behind the creation of AI are arguably the most important aspects of this new form of life.
<br><br>
As Descartes so famously asserts, &ldquo;I think therefore I am.&rdquo; The 17th Century French philosopher placed much emphasis on &ldquo;reason&rdquo; as the foundation of humanity. He believed that the sole act of thinking validates a human&#39;s existence. Their ability to think defines their personality, their very being. Thought and reason, according to Descartes, are able to be perceived clearly and without ambiguity, making them the essence of humanity. &ldquo;Humanity&rdquo; itself is term that spills beyond the constraints of a single, narrow definition. Rather it&#39;s a broad term that encompasses the complexities of human nature itself: decisions, personality, thoughts. However, if Descartes views are used as a premise to define humanity, then I would argue that AI possesses &ldquo;humanity.&rdquo; While AI&#39;s <a href="Page1.html" class="five">ability to think is debatable,</a> they are able to use some type of &#39;reason&#39; to learn. This &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; is what distinguishes AI from code that is simply programmed to do one task and only that task. An integral aspect of AI is a reasoning system. In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_system" class="one">reasoning system,</a> computer code uses available knowledge to inductively and deductively draw conclusions. This ability is unique to AI because it is using past information to inform its next “decisions” which is essentially what humans do everyday. AI has the ability to learn and apply what it has learned to future situations. In order for learning to occur, there must be reasoning. So, if AI has the ability to learn, and if reasoning is required for learning, then AI must be using reason. And if AI has the capacity to reason, then it has a level of humanity. As Neuromancer himself, the main AI in the novel declares, &ldquo;I create my own personality. Personality is my medium&rdquo; (250). And &ldquo;personality&rdquo; is an essential constituent of humanity. Personality is what makes humans&mdash;and AI&mdash;unique from one another. Because both humans and AI have personality, they should both be entitled to equal moral consideration. 
<br><br>
It also seems that The Father of Modern Philosophy is implying that &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; is a right to autonomy. However, in <i>Neuromancer,</i> autonomy is the &ldquo;bugaboo,&rdquo; (129) or the factor that people find most alarming. As a result, &ldquo;every Al ever built has an electromagnetic shotgun wired to its forehead" (129). The imagery of a shotgun pointed at the head of the AI implies both a forced and physical death, but also an intellectual one since the gun is &ldquo;wired to its forehead.&rdquo; Of course, the AI doesn&#39;t actually have a gun to its head, but it is essentially programmed by humans to self-destruct should it become too autonomous. This fear that humans harbor reveals the power and humanity that AI have the potential for or already have. However, it doesn&#39;t seem right that humans play God in the lives of AI.  
<br><br>
After all, &ldquo;Neuromancer was personality&rdquo; (259).
