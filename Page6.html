Define: Science Fiction;
<i>Fiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and major social or environmental changes, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.</i>
<br>
}

<br><br>

The future ultimately becomes the present. We are in the present, so aren&#39;t we in the &ldquo;future?&rdquo;
<br><br>
<i>&ldquo;O brave new world &frasl; That has such people in &#39;t!&rdquo;</i> Such people and such...robots? Such AI? Was Miranda so clairvoyantly referring to the diversity of beings that inhabit and challenge our understanding of &ldquo;people,&rdquo; of &ldquo;humans?&rdquo; Our existence as modern human beings is inextricable with those living around us as well as the technological realm we are submerged in. Humans are social creatures; it seems natural that we would create something, <i>someone</i> even, to quell our hunger for company. Social media was the entrance to this intangible world of connection. Facebook allows us to connect with &ldquo;real&rdquo; people, our friends across the street, the country, the world. But they are still people who we&#39;re interacting with. 
<br><br>
Except how does Facebook recognize that face? How is that your friend suggestions are actually people you know? <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/05/18/477819617/facebooks-facial-recognition-software-is-different-from-the-fbis-heres-why" class="one"> According to Yann LeCun,</a> the Director at Facebook AI Research, &ldquo;if we want to understand ourselves, we have to understand what intelligence is all about.&rdquo; Intelligence in the form of machines, whose code mimics the neural networks of our own brains. Though this concept may seem like it&#39;s been pulled from a science fiction novel, it is our reality. Now. 
<br><br>

<i>&ldquo;When the past is always with you, it may as well be present; and if it is present, it will be future as well&rdquo;</i> (id= &ldquo;William Gibson&rdquo;). 
<br><br>

Human-esque AI&#39;s do not exist solely within the pages of <i>Neuromancer</i> or <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.</i> <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uncanny-valley-robot-videos" class="one">Jules,</a> for example, is a robot whose sophisticated AI program enables him to have conversations. Not only is he &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; he unnervingly resembles a balding human male in his mid 30&#39;s. &ldquo;Resemblance&rdquo; may become an obsolete description; ultimately there will not be a relevant enough difference between humans and AI, especially as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaTfzYDZG8c" class="one">look more and more like &ldquo;us,&rdquo;</a> as they merge with &ldquo;us.&rdquo; 
<br><br>

<i>"No. She couldn't imagine what I'd be like&rdquo; (259). </i>
<br><br>

But I would argue that they, the authors of so many sci-fi novels could, <i>did,</i> imagine what they, AI, would be like. Almost exactly. We are living out those pages, the world of those words. William Gibson. Philip K Dick. Isaac Asimov. 
<br><br>

<i>"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science fiction gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom"</i> (id= &ldquo;Isaac Asimov&rdquo;).
<br><br>

&ldquo;Neuromancer was immortality&rdquo; (259). And so is imagination, technology and philosophy. One cannot exist without the others. 
<br><br>

Neuromancer, the paradigm of AI. &ldquo;His&rdquo; existence will transcend time, his &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; a display of power. Neuromancer is only the inception of AI and what&#39;s to come. In our time, in our future, AI will become more sophisticated, more ubiquitous, more immortal.</p>
