This New York Times article explores the efforts of major tech companies in creating a standard of ethics for AI. Though AI has been depicted as an “existential threat” to humans, this is a slight exaggeration of current issues regarding AI. The purpose of this ethics industry is to make certain that AI research focuses on benefiting people rather than harming them. Right now, there seems to be a divide between the “computer” and “social” scientists. Ethics initiatives like this one strive to bridge the gap between the two which I think is necessary if we are to coexist with AI. I am going to explore the ethical implications of AI in my essay. I think this article sheds light on the importance of setting up regulations and ethical standards for AI. The world of AI and the ability of AI is still unknown in many ways, which is even more reason to put regulations in place.

<div class = "indent"> This succinct article addresses some of the same topics as the other NYT’s article, "How Tech Giants Are Devising Real Ethics for Artificial Intelligence." It discusses the plans of CMU to create a research center focused on the ethics of AI. It also talks about the advancement of technology and the sophistication of AI, and the effect this progression has on our society. For example, AI will be making more “ethical” choices, but who decides what is ethical and what is not? As AI continues to become more prevalent in our daily lives, we will need to consider the ethical decisions it makes as well as our ethical treatment toward AI. I plan to address the ethical aspects of AI in my essay. I think this article makes a valid point in saying that we need to open these types of ethical research centers for AI since our lives are now inextricably tied with theirs.

<div class = "indent">Schwitzgebel and Garza argue that AI is entitled to basic rights. They focus on several points, specifically that there is no relevant difference between humans and AI, that “artificial” itself is an ambiguous term, and that it is possible for AI to attain consciousness that is virtually identical to human consciousness. As a result, it would be immoral to deprive AI of basic rights. 
Since I am leaning towards arguing that AI is more human than not and should have rights, I will likely use some of the arguments presented in this essay. For example, I hadn’t considered that we (as humans) have a responsibility to care for AI—much like we do children—because humans are the ones who imbue AI with “life.” I would use the “no relevant difference” idea to argue that if AI have the criteria of what makes a human human (e.g. having “consciousness, creativity, emotionality, self-conception, rationality” (13)), then they should be entitled to basic rights and moral treatment.
I think there are many ambiguities surrounding the rights and treatment of AI. After reading Neuromancer and this article I think that AI (especially as it becomes more sophisticated), deserves moral consideration.
