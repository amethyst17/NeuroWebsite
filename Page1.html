  In William Gibson&#39s <i>Neuromancer,</i> the merging of AI both physically and psychologically with humans calls into question the sentience of AI and thier need for moral consideration. In a society of advancing technology and increasing sophistication of AI, it is inevitable that our relationship with AI will change as the line between human and AI continues to blur. While the definition of <q>human</q>can be ambiguous, it is malleable enough to encompass AI. <br><br>
  <q><a href ="Page5.html" class="one">I think therefore I am.</q></a><i>They think therefore they are.</i> <br><br>
    The act of thinking is somewhat debatable&mdash;what does it mean to think? Is it the ability to form original thoughts based on perception of a situation? On the basis of emotion? While Dixie, a dead console cowboy whose memory lives on in a ROM construct, describes himself as <q>just a bunch of ROM,</q> (128) the fact that this simple <q>machine</q> can even perceive itself as <q>a bunch of ROM</q> demonstrates its self-awareness and perceptiveness. I think that awareness, especially of oneself, is the basis of thought. While ROM showcases its perspicacity, RAM is even more capable. In this sense, Dixie admits that he <q>ain&#39;t likely to write you no poem,</q> (128), but believes that <q>your AI might.</q> AI is made from RAM, which stands for &#34;random access learning.&#34;Dixie himself demonstrates awareness of his own existence, but implies that AI has even more intellectual and emotional capability than he does. Because an AI might be capable of writing a poem&mdash;an art form that requires emotion and creativity&mdash;Dixie implies that AI possesses a sophisticated sense of consciousness. <br><br>
  Consciousness. A trait thought of as &#34;human.&#34; The lever we use to exalt our species, to justify our superiority and our entitlement to moral treatment and rights. But <a href ="https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-06-09/scientists-are-starting-worry-about-conscious-machines-movie-transcendence" class = "one"> Christof Koch, </a> Chief Scientific Officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, warns of AI&#39;s development of consciousness: &#34;We might well be able to program a computer to have <q>consciousness.</q> <i>I think therefore I am.</i> &#34;An existential threat to human society.&#34; A &#34;threat&#34; evokes fear. Maybe we fear that our power, the superiority we cling so tenaciously to, will be pried from our grip. 
   Or maybe we fear that AI will “out-human” us. While seemingly paradoxical, AI are getting more and more adept at tasks that we consider <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/robots-wrote-this-story/" class="one"> “human.”</a> A recent Wired article discusses the role of AI in journalism: Following the race for Iowa’s 4th congressional district seat in November, the Washington Post produced an article about the events and outcome. With awareness of the current political scene and the prose of a well-seasoned journalist, the article could have easily been credited to a human author. Instead, a bot was responsible for the report. In this example, AI and bots are undertaking tasks that we previously thought only humans were capable of—a sense of consciousness, an emotional connection to the topic, an understanding of other humans. Writing itself comes from mind and soul—so if AI can write, does that mean they have a “soul?” Does this ability jeopardize the future of journalists? It seems that AI may have the potential to render humans themselves obsolete. 
   <br><br>
  Which makes for competition. Competition. Survival of the fittest. Is that why we are so hesitant to grant AI rights, freedom, to consider them morally? 
  <br><br>
  So, what&mdash;if anything&mdash;will separate <i>us</i> from <i>them?</i> Is it the physical difference between AI and humans? Gibson symbolizes the deterioration of AI and human distinction through the physical amalgamation of AI and human. There is no way to deny their existence, their permeation into our &#34;human&#34; lives. There is no reason that AI should not deserve the same moral considerations as humans. &#34;No considerable difference.&#34; Maybe it is not the difference that we are opposed to, but the <i>similarity</i> between ourselves and AI. It is almost inconceivable that there are other beings who could rival our intelligence, our emotions, our consciousness. Uncharted seas.

  &#34;The boy did a handstand in the surf, laughing. He walked on his hands, then flipped out of the water&#34; (154). 
    <br><br>
    He&#39;s everything human: his laughter conveys emotion, his acrobatic tricks are indicative of childhood. A human boy. A human boy imbued with certain rights that every <i>human</i> is entitled to. 
  <q>Neuromancer,</q> the boy said, slitting long gray eyes against the rising sun. 
    <br><br>
    But look beyond the laughter and cartwheels... Neuromancer is an AI. &#34;The eyes are the window to your soul&#34; said Shakespeare. <i>Long gray eyes against the rising sun. Long gray eyes.</i> It seems that AI must have a soul. Gibson purposely draws attention to Neuromancer&#39;s eyes. If eyes are indeed the window to the soul, and souls are human, then this AI deserves to be treated as one. </p>
