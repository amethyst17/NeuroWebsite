    <h1 id="cor">CORPORATE POWER</h1>
   <p>
  Corporate corruption. Corporate greed. Corporate scandal. In a world of rampant capitalism, corporations not known for their transparency or good character. This perception of large corporations is no different in <i>Neuromancer,</i> as &ldquo;power, in Case&#39;s world, meant corporate power&rdquo; (196). 
  <br><br>
The Tessier-Ashpool family, a wealthy family run like a corporation, possesses large sums of money which they use to buy a sprawling amount of property. Ravenous for power and an everlasting legacy, the TA family not only invests in cryogenics to achieve immortality, they also pour an abundance of resources into creating AI. While not all of the family agrees with her decision, Marie-France Tessier foresees a &ldquo;symbiotic relationship&rdquo; with the Al's (220). However, the Turing Law Code regulates the autonomy of AI, as they are legally &ldquo;not allowed any autonomy&rdquo; (71). To get around the law, the TA family splits the AI into two entities, <a href="Page3.html" class="three">Wintermute</a> and Neuromancer. Despite the law, these AI seem to have a considerable amount of autonomy. With this human-like autonomy, Wintermute is able to manipulate Case and Molly. The &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo; (121) that Wintermute is capable of reveals the sinister motives of the corporation. <i>Corporate corruption.</i> The TA family exhibits their ability to use an AI for their gain. Marie-France Tessier explicitly mentions her desire for &ldquo;corporate decisions [to be] made for us&rdquo; (220) by AI&#39;s. Similarly, in our society, many wealthy corporations have the means to manipulate the public. In the media, corporations can pay for certain ads to be shown in order to advance their motives. For example, in 2016, the tobacco company spent copious amounts of money on advertising to oppose Prop 56, which would increase the tax on cigarettes. Even though the the bill barely managed to pass, these major corporations exhibited their power and influence over the public. But what do cigarette taxes have to do with AI and corporate power? Aside from Case&#39;s fetish for cigarettes, the point is that corporations have a lot of power. And what is to stop them from utilizing other means of manipulation such as AI when it becomes available? Nothing. In the Guardian article &ldquo;AI abuse,&rdquo; the author discusses the very real possibility of corrupt institutions abusing the power of AI. 
<br><br>
And this theme in ubiquity in sci-fi dystopian futures. As in Neuromancer, Blade Runner examines the ability of corrupt corporations to exploit the power they have over AI. In Blade Runner, the Tyrell Corporation manufactures &ldquo;replicants,&rdquo; AI that are virtually identical to humans. &ldquo;More human than human&rdquo; so says the company&#39;s slogan. More human than human? So shouldn&#39;t they at least have human rights too? Apparently not, according to corporate standards. But by humanity&#39;s standards, by using the heart and not the wallet, there&#39;s no reason that these &ldquo;more human than humans&rdquo; should have the same rights.
